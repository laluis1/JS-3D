# JS-3D
A little 3d test I put together to understand how 3d games work better. It so far isnt the most funtional as I 
need to improve how it orders what it draws and what to do when triangles layer over each other. I also need to
make it run better as right now it is very slow. My goal is to have a small  3d library for me to make some very
basic javascript games with.
